# Crowdfunding-ETL
Project 2 in UO Data Analytics Bootcamp
#### Project collaborators:
- Naomi Baxter
- Jamie Kawaguchi



#### Project Premise 

This project was designed to help us practices building an ETL pipeline. In the project we used Python, Pandas, and regular expression to extract and tranform the data. After the data was transformed, we loaded it into a CSV file so it could be used to create an ERD and schema table. Finally, we uploaded the CSV files into Postgres to create our database and used the SELECT * FROM SQL function to check the tables. 

#### Repository Contents

The respository includes: 
- Two riginal .xlsx files the data was from
- A jupyter notebook with the structure of our ETL pipeline
- Four CSV files we created
- Schema for Postgres used to create tables and check them
